### First Requirement in this task is to design an electrical circuit that can control five servo motors 

- By using Tinkercad I design a circuit that included 5 Servo Motors, 1 Arduino Uno, Wires 
- I connected the Motors with the digital part in the Arduino 

### Second Requirement in this task is Programming the circuit to make the Motors move at a 90 degree

- For the code, I used some sources on the internet to find the perfect fit and I added some features to the code to be clear and effective and fit my requirements which is Moving the Motors 90 degree

### Third Requirement in this task is Programming the Servo Motors to Move based on Variable Resistors 

- First I added Five potentiometers to the Analog parts in the Arduino 
- I added some extra features to the original code to make the potentiometers control the movement of the Motors
